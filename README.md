# Colordice
Javascript thingy that allows you to roll and highlight random hex color values with clicks of buttons.

You can use it to roll for colors that may inspire your next design, or to explore new colors when you feel bored with the colorset that you've been working with for too long.

A cool thing to add would be to show a hex color circle for whatever hex value has been rolled, or another 'bigger picture' way to show where your randomed hex value lies in the scheme of all colors.
